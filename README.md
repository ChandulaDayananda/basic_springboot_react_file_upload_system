React & Spring Boot Multiple File Upload Application
A modern full-stack web application for uploading, listing, and downloading multiple files, built with a React frontend and a Spring Boot backend. This project demonstrates robust file handling, RESTful API design, and seamless cross-origin integration.

🚀 Features
Multiple File Upload: Upload several files at once through a clean, intuitive React interface.

File Listing & Download: View all uploaded files and download any with a single click.

RESTful API: Spring Boot backend exposes secure, efficient endpoints for file management.

CORS Enabled: Out-of-the-box support for cross-origin requests between frontend and backend.

Easy Setup: Minimal configuration, ready to run locally for rapid development and learning.

Modular & Extensible: Clean code structure for easy customization and scaling.

🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-springboot-multifile-upload.git
cd react-springboot-multifile-upload
2. Start the Spring Boot Backend
bash
cd springboot-file-upload
./mvnw spring-boot:run
Backend runs at http://localhost:8081

3. Start the React Frontend
bash
cd ../react-file-upload
npm install
npm start
Frontend runs at http://localhost:3000

💡 How It Works
Select Multiple Files:
Use the file picker to select one or more files.

Upload:
Files are sent to the backend via a REST API (/uploadMultiple).

List & Download:
All uploaded files are displayed with download links, fetched from the backend.

✨ Customization
Change Upload Directory:
Edit application.properties in the backend to set a custom upload path.

Add Authentication:
Integrate JWT or OAuth2 for secure uploads.

Database Storage:
Modify the backend to store files as BLOBs or save metadata in a database.
